<p><h1><i><u>Welcome!</u></i></h1></p>

Please read this carefully!

This app is made to install the init.d script that controls your datafix. It also creates 
the move_cache.txt and the skip_apps.txt files already known. Besides that the app is able 
to clear caches and data for every app, even when a datafix is applied, not nessessairy the 
one done by this init.d script.
</p>

<p><i><b>move_cache.txt</i></b> <br />
the move_cache.txt file is created by checking the checkboxes on the main screen. 
apps in this file will store their caches on /data/data/*, potentially saving a lot of space 
on the fast /datadata. Gmail and Downloads are checked by default.
</p>

<p><i><b>skip_apps.txt</i></b> <br />
The apps in this file will have all their data on the huge but slow /data/data/*.
</p>

<p><i><b>Install button</i></b> <br />
Once pressed install you will have a confirmation dialog, read carefully what will be 
added to which file. You can choose between cancel (obvious), install without reboot and 
with reboot. Both options will create the init.d script if the checkbox is checked and make 
the .txt files.
</p>

<p><i><b>App details</i></b> <br />
You can press on every entry in the list. This will show where this app currently has its data 
and gives you the option to wipe its cache or all its data. Empty folders will show 4kB, symlinks 
and non-existing folders will show 0kB
</p>

<p><i><b>Nandroid</i></b> <br />
If you choose to make a nandroid backup from within this app, 
you have to realize that this function is only available for 
CWM based recoveries. TWRP is not supported by me at the moment. 
If you want to help in this, feel free to PM me on XDA or email 
zatta.xda@gmail.com.<br />
The nandroid will be in:<br /> <i>/sdcard/clockworkmod/backup
/2012-07-10.19.14.12-datafix</i>
