This app is a cooperation between Zatta and Wendigogo, both members of 
XDA-developers. The init.d script that does the actual work (and has 
been around for some time) is done by Wendigogo, the app to control the script 
is done by Zatta.

On Samsung Galaxy S, cyanogenmod 7 creates a ~175MB yaffs partition 
which holds all app data. This partition is mounted at /datadata and 
the usual location of this directory at /data/data is a symbolic link 
that points to /datadata.

<p><i>
$ ls -l /data/data <br />
lrwxrwxrwx 1 system system 9 Oct 8 19:34 /data/data -&gt; /datadata</i></p>

<p>
The app apk itself does not reside here, but data created by the app 
resides here, especially, the app's sqlite databases and user 
preference xml files. The cyanogenmod developers did it this way to 
address the lag experienced on the stock Galaxy S firmware. But, this produces a problem.

The /datadata partition is quite small and may be filled up 
quickly by an app that caches a lot of data (g+ for example). 
Once /datadata fills up, apps will begin force closing since they will not 
be able to create any new data on /datadata. The ext4 /data partition, 
which is about 2GB, has plenty of space free. So, it is attractive to move /datadata 
onto this large partition. But then we have the lag problem again. That's where this 
script comes in. It moves certain subdirectories from each app on the ext4 partition. 
Default select the "lib" &amp; "libs" subdirectories as here are static files : with 
only read access, ext4 performances are not so bad compared to yaffs ones.
